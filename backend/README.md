# Synthetic Data Studio — Backend

This repository contains the backend for Synthetic Data Studio. The codebase
has been refactored into modular packages under `app/` (core, auth, datasets,
projects, generators, synthetic_datasets, compliance, jobs, storage).

This README is a placeholder; expand with run instructions, testing tips, and
deployment notes.
