git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name-or-bugfix-description
```

5. **Make Your Changes:** Implement your changes.
6. **Write Tests:** Ensure your changes are covered by appropriate unit and integration tests.
7. **Run Tests:**

```bash
# Placeholder for how to run tests
# cd backend && pytest
# cd frontend && npm test
```

8. **Lint Your Code:** Adhere to the project's coding style. (Tools like Black for Python, ESLint for JS).
9. **Commit Your Changes:** Write clear, concise commit messages.
10. **Push to Your Fork:**

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name-or-bugfix-description
